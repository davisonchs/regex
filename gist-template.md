## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors define where a pattern should appear in the string, specifying its position.

-Caret (^)
What It Does: Matches the start of a string.
Example: ^Hello matches "Hello" only if it's at the beginning of the string.

-Dollar Sign ($)
What It Does: Matches the end of a string.
Example: world$ matches "world" only if it's at the end of the string.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers determine the number of times a character, group, or character class must appear in the input for a match to occur.

-Asterisk (*)
What It Does: Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding pattern.
Example: a* matches "", "a", "aa", "aaa", etc.

-Plus (+)

What It Does: Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding pattern.
Example: a+ matches "a", "aa", "aaa", but not "".
